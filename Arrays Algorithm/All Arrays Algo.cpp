✅ 1. Linear Search
Definition:
Check every element one by one to find the target value.
Time: O(n)

✅ 2. Binary Search
Definition:
Search in a sorted array by dividing it into half each time.
Time: O(log n)

✅ 3. Kadane’s Algorithm
Definition:
Find the maximum subarray sum (largest sum of continuous elements).
Time: O(n)

✅ 4. Two Pointer Technique
Definition:
Use two variables (pointers) to solve problems like sorted pair sum, reverse array, etc.
Time: O(n)

✅ 5. Sliding Window Technique
Definition:
Use a fixed-size or variable-size window to solve problems like max sum subarray of size k.
Time: O(n)

✅ 6. Prefix Sum / Cumulative Sum
Definition:
Create an array where each element is the sum of all previous elements, to answer range sum queries quickly.
Time: O(n) for prefix, O(1) for query

✅ 7. Dutch National Flag Algorithm
Definition:
Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s in linear time.
Used in: Sort Colors problem
Time: O(n)

✅ 8. Moore’s Voting Algorithm
Definition:
Find the majority element (that appears more than n/2 times).
Time: O(n)

✅ 9. Merge Sort (for Inversion Count)
Definition:
Used to count inversions in an array. Also used to sort.
Time: O(n log n)

✅ 10. Quickselect Algorithm
Definition:
Used to find the kth smallest/largest element in array.
Time: O(n) average

✅ 11. XOR Algorithm
Definition:
Used to find the missing number, duplicate, or single non-repeating element.
Time: O(n)

✅ 12. Merge Intervals
Definition:
Used in interval-based problems to combine overlapping intervals.
Time: O(n log n)

✅ 13. Frequency Count using Hashing
Definition:
Count how many times each number appears using a map or array.
Time: O(n)

✅ 14. Sorting Algorithms (used with arrays)
Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swap if elements are in wrong order – O(n²)
Selection Sort: Select minimum every time – O(n²)
Insertion Sort: Insert element at correct place – O(n²)
Merge Sort: Divide and merge – O(n log n)
Quick Sort: Pick pivot and sort around it – O(n log n) average
